# hello-world

Hi,

I'm Chelsea - I am a graphic designer who has realised that I would much prefer to build websites rather than just make them look pretty. So I'm currently teaching myself HTML5, CSS3 & Javascript.

I enjoy pina coladas & long walks on the beach (That last ones a lie, I actually really dislike the beach!).
